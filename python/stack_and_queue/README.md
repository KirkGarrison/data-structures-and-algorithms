# Stacks and Queues
Stacks and Queues when using Node's operate much like LinkedLists do. Being an operator that points to other values/things. Stacks use a First in, Last out method. Queue's use a First in, First Out method.

## Challenge
Write code and tests for two classes (Stack class and Queue class) that passes the functional tests listed in the challenge.

## Approach & Efficiency
Initially I tried to approach this with a similar idea to linkedLists. With the code methodology, there are some similiarities. The challenge came with the functional differences and order of Node operation that came with Stacks and Queues.

## API
No API's used.
