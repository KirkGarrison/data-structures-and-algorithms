# Graphs
- Graphs are a data structure similar to binary tree, but with some structural differences.

## Challenge
- Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:
    -   add note
    -   add edge
    -   get nodes
    -   get neighbors
    -   size

## Approach & Efficiency
- For this approach it was a lot to learn. I followed along during the demo, and will dive more into this and (hopefully) get more CC practice to solidify this new data structure.

## API
- No API's used


## Challenge
- Write a breadth first method on the Graph class

## Approach & Efficiency
- I looked to my previous breadth first on the BinaryTree for inspiration, and watch a [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQhMkmhYZjQ) video for additional ideas

## Solution
