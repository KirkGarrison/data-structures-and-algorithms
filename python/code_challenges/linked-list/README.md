# Singly Linked List
Program that utilizes a LinkedList to insert and verify object values inside of List

## Challenge
Create a LinkedList that has a Insert, Includes, True and False check for values. The Insert should be an O(1) method.

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to try to understand how LinkedLists are structured and created on a deeper level. So I rewatched the lab and paused frequently to further wrap my head around what was happening and why.

## API
No API's used for this Code Challenge.
