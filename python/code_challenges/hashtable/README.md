## Description
Implement a Hash Table Class with an add, get, contains, and hash method.

## Tests
I did tests for the following:
Add
Get
Contains
Hash
In accordance with the required methods for this code challenge.

## Approach and Efficiency
The explanation of examples provided by JB and knowing that we have been using Hash tables all along was somehow comforting. Something about knowing that this wasn't anything new or crazy complicated, made my approach more calm.
I utilized a his example and also researched a bit of the concepts online to figure out a method to implement this for the code challenge.

## API's
None used.
