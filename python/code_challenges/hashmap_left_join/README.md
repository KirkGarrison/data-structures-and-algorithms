Write a function called left_join that takes in 2 hashmaps, and returns a single hashmap.

## Approach & Efficiency
I initially wanted to use a ** operator, then I found out about the | operator in python (new to 3.9). The | allows you to merge two dictionaries, however it doesn't seem to allow duplicate values to a key, so I had to use an iterative method instead.
