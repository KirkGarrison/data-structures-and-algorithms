# Challenge Summary
Create an AnimalShelter class that only takes in Dog or Cat instances, and defaults to dequeueing the animal with the longest stay first.

## Approach & Efficiency
I followed my previous stack_queue_pseudo formatting to build out most of this lab. And also reviewed the lab info from todays lecture.
Enqueue
Time: O(N)
Space O(1)
Dequeue
Time O(N)
Space O(1)
