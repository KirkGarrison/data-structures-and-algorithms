# Trees
Trees use Nodes as values and store them either 'root', 'left', or 'right'. It is similar to a linkedlist, however it is stuctured differently.

## Challenge
Create a Node, BinaryTree, and BinarySearchTree class, and write tests to ensure functionality.

## Approach & Efficiency
I took notes during the lecture and used the demo code as reference as I create my own version of this assignment.

## API
No API's were used in the making of this assignment.
