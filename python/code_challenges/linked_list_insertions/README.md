Write an append, insert before and insert after method for a LinkedList class.

Whiteboard Process


Approach & Efficiency
Since this challenge required tests and we had access to using a code editor, I began all of my work in VScode and started with writing tests, then used the red>green>refactor method to build out each test.

Solution


Kth position of linked list

Challenge
Create a method to return the kth value of the node based on user input

Whiteboard Process


Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to review how I was able to get the nth value from the fibonacci sequence, then do some research on how I could apply that logic to finding it within a LinkedList.
